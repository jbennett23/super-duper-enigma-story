There once was a girl who did not know what an enigma was. It made it hard for her to write a super duper story about it. However, in the comfort on her home, she was able to prevail.
The enigma she came up with was "What falls, but does not break, and what breaks but does not fall?"
She asked all of her friends but no one knew the answer. After her CS exam, she went up to her professor to see if she could solve the riddle.
